# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ðŸš¢

This repository contains my analysis and solutions for the **[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)** competition on Kaggle. The notebook explores the dataset, performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applies feature engineering techniques, and builds predictive models to determine survival outcomes based on passenger data.

## Features
- **EDA**: Visualizations and insights to understand the data distribution and key survival patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features (e.g., `Title`, `FamilySize`, `AgeGroup`) to enhance model performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Evaluation
> It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable & model "Accuracy".

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Ml-From-Disaster.git
 
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Run the jupyter notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Result

The notebook provides insights into key factors affecting survival on the Titanic and demonstrates how feature engineering can significantly improve model predictions.

This model has placed 2364^th position in the contest with a score of `0.78468`
