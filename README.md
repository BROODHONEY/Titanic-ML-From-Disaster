# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

This repository contains my analysis and solutions for the **[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)** competition on Kaggle. The notebook explores the dataset, performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applies feature engineering techniques, and builds predictive models to determine survival outcomes based on passenger data.

## Features
- **EDA**: Visualizations and insights to understand the data distribution and key survival patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features (e.g., `Title`, `FamilySize`, `AgeGroup`) to enhance model performance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Evaluation
> It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable & model "Accuracy".

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Ml-From-Disaster.git
 
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Run the jupyter notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Result

The notebook provides insights into key factors affecting survival on the Titanic and demonstrates how feature engineering can significantly improve model predictions.

This model has placed 2375th position in the contest with a score of `0.78468`
